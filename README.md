# 🧠 Master Pattern

Master Pattern is an interactive cognitive learning game inspired by the classic Simon Game. It was redesigned to overcome some limitations of traditional implementations by introducing educational, accessibility, and engagement-focused features for children.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Most Simon-style games:

- Replay the entire sequence at the beginning of every round.
- Have no response time constraints.
- Rely solely on visual color cues.
- Primarily focus on entertainment.

Master Pattern aims to provide a more engaging and educational experience by encouraging memory retention, alphabet recognition, and multisensory learning.

## ✨ Features

### 🔤 Alphabet-Based Gameplay

Instead of colored pie segments, the game uses alphabetic symbols (`A-F`) to help children familiarize themselves with letters.

### 🔊 Voice-Assisted Learning

Each box has an associated voiceover.

Clicking or selecting a box plays its pronunciation, allowing children to rely on auditory cues in addition to visual cues.

### 🧠 Incremental Memory Training

Unlike traditional Simon games, the entire sequence is **not replayed** at the start of every level.

Only the newly added symbol is shown.

Players must remember previously learned symbols independently.

Example:

Level 1

```text
Shows: A
Input: A
```

Level 2

```text
Shows: C
Input: A C
```

Level 3

```text
Shows: F
Input: A C F
```

### ⏳ Adaptive Time Constraints

Players are given a limited time to respond.

Response time increases gradually with level progression while being capped to maintain challenge.

### ⌨️ Multi-Platform Support

Supports:

- Mouse clicks
- Laptop keyboards
- Mobile touch interactions

making the game accessible across multiple devices.

### 🎨 Child-Friendly Design

Features:

- Soft pastel color palette
- Animations
- Audio feedback
- Responsive interface
